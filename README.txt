## Overview  
This project is a simple digital library system that allows users to store, search, and recommend books.  
It demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python and compares two search methods — linear and dictionary-based — with timing analysis.

## Features  
- Add, remove, and list books  
- Linear and dictionary search  
- Top-rated and genre-based recommendations  
- Borrow and return system  
- Timing comparison test  

## Files  
- `book.py` – Book class  
- `library.py` – Library management and algorithms  
- `user.py` – User management  
- `data_generator.py` – Generates large random book datasets  
- `test_cases.py` – Demonstrates all functionality
